Hi!

This is straight up a mess. There is a lot of poorly written python code here related to computer vision,
and it was all labelled so that I didn't have to think about the name when executing code.

This course forced me to be better at python and I got a lot better over time,
but I might want to look back someday on the tricks I learned and forgotten, so I'm storing it here.

Don't judge this folder too hard. For people looking for example code to fix some random problem, I recommend looking other
places. I did ok in the course BUT you can do better these solutions for sure. I have faith in you.
